#Project Proposal - BlockPuzzle
###Objective of the Game
This project is a recreation of the popular mobile game Block Puzzle. In this game, 
a player tries to attain a high score by arranging tetris blocks to fill a horizontal row
or column. Once a column, row, or multiple columns and rows are filled, the game clears that section and adds to the player's score.
The game ends once the player has no more places to put the blocks. 

###Implementation
This project will be using Cinder to recreate the game of Block Puzzle.
