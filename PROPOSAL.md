#Project Proposal - 8 Ball Pool
###Objective of the Game
This project is a recreation of the popular iMessage game 8 Ball Pool. In this game there are two players who play the 
standard game of pool with physics simulations.

###Implementation
This project will be using Cinder and OpenGL to recreate the game of 8 ball
pool. The cue can be controlled by the mouse, and clicking and dragging to the opposite
direction to control its speed and direction. If more time is available, there can be
implementations of different cues, spins, and more features like wireless multiplayer to the game. 

###Timeline
* Week 1 
    * Implement the physics engine
    * Design and display a simple table and balls that interact correctly
