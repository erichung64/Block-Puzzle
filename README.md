# Block Puzzle

## Introduction
Block Puzzle is a game based on the popular mobile app "Block Puzzle". The main
gameplay centers around strategically placing blocks on a grid to attain a high score by arranging tetris blocks to fill a horizontal row
or column. Once a column, row, or multiple columns and rows are filled, the game clears that section and adds to the player's score.
The game ends once the player has no more places to put the blocks.
